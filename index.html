            <p class="first">I am very scared about my life . The thoughts,when i am alone every day and nights scared me . I don't belive in god when i was a child , but the day i go to in my village temple ,the place i found the peace and the discussion between me and god give my mind a mental peace.I think it is very much more need for my mental peace.Then i started reading BHAGWAT GEETA and then i realise the meaning of life and how to survive.
